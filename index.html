        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p>
          As you can see by this eloquently designed webpage I am well versed in website
          management and development. On top of that I have experience in roles that
          involved heavy orginazational and mangerial elements, and I am used to working
          to meet deadlines with as much speed and quality as humanly possible.
          That's not all I have to offer either:
          <p>- Excellent Numeracy Skills (Minor in Physics)</p>
          <p>- Compter Programming Prowess</p>
          <p>- Hard Working and Enthusiastic</p>
          <p>- Quick Learner</p>
          <p>- Excellent Problem Solver and Critical Thinker</p>

      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
      <b>Hammond River Survival Camp</b>
      <p>
      At HRSC I worked three years as a Counselor and one year as the Head Counselor.
      My role as Head Counselor was primarily one of managment, I kept track of the inflow
      and outflow of money at camp and I would help the Camp Director with interstaff issues
      such as personal disputes amongst Counselors. I was promoted to Head Counselor due to
      my energy, enthuseasem and people skills.

      <p><b>McDonalds Canada</b></p>
      <p>
      I decided to include this job on my webresume because I felt like it was
      an excellent first job in the way that it helped build up my teamwork skills so much.
      McDonalds was such a crew driven experience and it taught me how to really
      work together towards a goal.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
       This section will be the area which contains ongoing projects and finished pieces of software so that you'll be
       able to see the quality of my work. For now I don't have enough done on my current personal software development
          project to spoil it's design but sometime around the middle of summer 2017 that more details will be disclosed.

      <section id="aboutme" class="section">
      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      To start things off in the 'about me' section I figured you'd like some proof as to exactly how enthusiastic I am.
          The following video was a commercial I starred in when I was 14. I included it because it is both funny and I think
          memorable, take a look:

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>I also like to boast about my excellent people skills. I was elected president of the student council in my senior year
          and because of that experience I gained a lot of very useful organizational skills which I applied both in my courses and
          to my old job as Head Counselor at a summer camp. I'm not only a pretty face, I also have great interest in Physics,
          Math and of course programming, this makes me a wonderful candidate for even data analysis jobs because I did plenty of
          statistical analysis of lab results during some of my more demanding courses. I have been told time and time again that
          I am pleasant to have around as I exude an energy not found elsewhere. I am also a extremely punctual person as one of
              my main pet peeves is being late as it impedes the entire team and delays operations. I believe that because of my
              strong work ethic and poitive demeanor that I would make a positive contribution to any work environment.
